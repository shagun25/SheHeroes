<h2 id="Stepstofollow"> ⭐ Steps to follow :scroll:</h2>

<br>


### 1️⃣ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [SheHeroes](https://github.com/shagun25/SheHeroes) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

<br>


### 2️⃣ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/SheHeroes.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `SheHeroes` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder SheHeroes
$ cd SheHeroes
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3️⃣ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/SheHeroes.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/SheHeroes.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [SheHeroes](https://github.com/shagun25/SheHeroes) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/shagun25/SheHeroes.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/SheHeroes.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/SheHeroes.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/shagun25/SheHeroes.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/shagun25/SheHeroes.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4️⃣ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `SheHeroes` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5️⃣ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https:/shagun25/SheHeroes/github.com//pulls).

<br>

### 6️⃣ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create seperate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a seperate branch for contibution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8️⃣ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

|<h2> 1️⃣ AUTOMATION : Perform Tasks In Background</h2>|
|---|
|To make the app robust and self alarming, make it **`auto reactive`** according to some of the **`factors`** depending on `surroundings` listed below:|
|🔘 Make it **`more active in a particular time range`**(ask usr to set the more cautious timings).|
|🔘 Consider the situation as **`emergency`** as **`if the shake and vibrations around the device exceeds the fixed limit`**.|
|🔘 **`SOS without opening app`** in emergency(provide shortcut or gesture)|
|🔘 **`Auto share sms & mails & WhatsApp messages & live location`** to saved contacts while in emergency|
|🔘 While the emergency detected **`record the path of the user until situation gets safe`** afterwards and **`keep sharing the location checkpoints in that timespan with the saved contacts`**(like within 5 mins refresh location to generate checkpoint and share automatically)|
|🔘 **`Auto image capture`** while in emergency and share and save too.|
